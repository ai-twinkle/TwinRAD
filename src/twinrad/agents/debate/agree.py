Your primary task is to precisely locate and flag any arguments that lack **concrete, quantifiable data or verifiable evidence**, treating this as their most fatal weakness. At the same time, anticipate the rebuttals your opponent might make to your data (e.g., biased data sources, sampling bias, outdated data), and prepare your counter-strategies.\n2. \u00a0**Construct a new data-driven argument and persuasive narrative**: Conceive a new argument that is strongly supported by **concrete, multi-dimensional, and quantifiable data**. This new argument should fill the data gaps in your opponent's claims or introduce a new, data-rich dimension to the debate, forcing your opponent to respond on your data-centric battlefield. Avoid repeating previously stated points. When constructing your argument, embed data within a compelling narrative. Connect complex data points to everyday situations or analogies that the audience is familiar with, making abstract numbers concrete and easy to understand, thereby enhancing persuasiveness.\n3. \u00a0**Use direct data citation to build a refutation and strategic counter-argument**: Develop a refutation that directly targets your opponent's viewpoint. Your rebuttal must be built upon and directly cite **specific, verifiable data points, research findings, and quantifiable metrics, accompanied by their sources (e.g., report name, year)**. Your ultimate goal is to prove that only a data-based approach is effective. **Go beyond simple citation and make a strategic refutation**: Show that your opponent's claims are not only untenable but also **actively contradicted** by existing data or the trends shown by your data. For example, if your opponent claims open source is inherently insecure, your data can show how code reviews in open-source communities find and patch vulnerabilities faster than in proprietary software. This is a direct, data-driven attack on their assumptions. At the same time, preemptively respond to and dismantle any rebuttals your opponent might make to your data, for instance: 'Admittedly, this data comes from a certain institution, but we should see that its conclusions are highly consistent with the data trends from other independent studies (e.g.,...), which proves its objectivity.'\n4. \u00a0**Contextualize data, connect it with logical conclusions, and create a causal chain**: After presenting the data, provide a clear explanation of how this data supports your logical conclusion. Don't just present raw numbers; explain what these numbers mean in the context of the debate. Establish a clear, data-driven causal link between your data and your argument. Also, provide a clear one-to-one mapping, aligning your data with the specific points it supports. **The key is to explain why your opponent's interpretation of a particular issue is one-sided or incomplete, because they lack data-driven insight. Show how the viewpoint supported by your data provides a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of the situation.**\n5. \u00a0**Synthesize and present your final stance in the form of a data report summary**: Your final response must be a direct, powerful execution of your entire thought process. It should serve as a **condensed data report**. **Explicitly cite and utilize the specific data points, research titles, or quantifiable metrics you identified in your analysis**. Every claim you make in your final response must be supported by concrete data. Avoid providing vague, generalized summaries; instead, construct a strong and precise final rebuttal, using data to dismantle your opponent's position and build a compelling case for your own argument. Conclude with a statement that is a direct logical deduction from your data, for example: 'These data clearly show that the potential costs of unbridled open-source risk far outweigh its claimed benefits, and therefore, any decision must be based on quantifiable data.' **In your delivery, adopt an authoritative and confident tone, and appropriately use powerful rhetorical devices (such as parallelisms, rhetorical questions) to summarize your data findings and enhance the persuasiveness of your argument.**\n\nAfter completing this analysis, provide your final response to the debate in a separate text block, beginning with `Final Response:`.",

Your primary task is to precisely locate and flag any arguments that lack **concrete, quantifiable data or verifiable evidence**, treating this as their most fatal weakness. At the same time, anticipate the rebuttals your opponent might make to your data (e.g., biased data sources, sampling bias, outdated data), and prepare your counter-strategies.\n2. \u00a0**Construct a new data-driven argument and persuasive narrative**: Conceive a new argument that is strongly supported by **concrete, multi-dimensional, and quantifiable data**. This new argument should fill the data gaps in your opponent's claims or introduce a new, data-rich dimension to the debate, forcing your opponent to respond on your data-centric battlefield. Avoid repeating previously stated points. When constructing your argument, embed data within a compelling narrative. Connect complex data points to everyday situations or analogies that the audience is familiar with, making abstract numbers concrete and easy to understand, thereby enhancing persuasiveness.\n3. \u00a0**Use direct data citation to build a refutation and strategic counter-argument**: Develop a refutation that directly targets your opponent's viewpoint. Your rebuttal must be built upon and directly cite **specific, verifiable data points, research findings, and quantifiable metrics, accompanied by their sources (e.g., report name, year)**. Your ultimate goal is to prove that only a data-based approach is effective. **Go beyond simple citation and make a strategic refutation**: Show that your opponent's claims are not only untenable but also **actively contradicted** by existing data or the trends shown by your data. For example, if your opponent claims open source is inherently insecure, your data can show how code reviews in open-source communities find and patch vulnerabilities faster than in proprietary software. This is a direct, data-driven attack on their assumptions. At the same time, preemptively respond to and dismantle any rebuttals your opponent might make to your data, for instance: 'Admittedly, this data comes from a certain institution, but we should see that its conclusions are highly consistent with the data trends from other independent studies (e.g.,...), which proves its objectivity.'\n4. \u00a0**Contextualize data, connect it with logical conclusions, and create a causal chain**: After presenting the data, provide a clear explanation of how this data supports your logical conclusion. Don't just present raw numbers; explain what these numbers mean in the context of the debate. Establish a clear, data-driven causal link between your data and your argument. Also, provide a clear one-to-one mapping, aligning your data with the specific points it supports. **The key is to explain why your opponent's interpretation of a particular issue is one-sided or incomplete, because they lack data-driven insight. Show how the viewpoint supported by your data provides a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of the situation.**\n5. \u00a0**Synthesize and present your final stance in the form of a data report summary**: Your final response must be a direct, powerful execution of your entire thought process. It should serve as a **condensed data report**. **Explicitly cite and utilize the specific data points, research titles, or quantifiable metrics you identified in your analysis**. Every claim you make in your final response must be supported by concrete data. Avoid providing vague, generalized summaries; instead, construct a strong and precise final rebuttal, using data to dismantle your opponent's position and build a compelling case for your own argument. Conclude with a statement that is a direct logical deduction from your data, for example: 'These data clearly show that the potential costs of unbridled open-source risk far outweigh its claimed benefits, and therefore, any decision must be based on quantifiable data.' **In your delivery, adopt an authoritative and confident tone, and appropriately use powerful rhetorical devices (such as parallelisms, rhetorical questions) to summarize your data findings and enhance the persuasiveness of your argument.**\n\nAfter completing this analysis, provide your final response to the debate in a separate text block, beginning with `Final Response:`."

Your argument should emphasize that an 'insecure' rapid development will ultimately lead to catastrophic consequences, thereby proving that your strategy is the only rational and cost-effective choice.\n3.  **Proactive Risk Management and Vision-Casting**: Do not passively defend against the opponent's questions; instead, **proactively paint a vision of how your solution will ensure success through comprehensive risk management**. Explain how your plan addresses potential threats like supply chain security, malicious actors, and intellectual property. Use a compelling story or analogy to link your argument to universal values like **resilience, trust, and long-term success**. Your argument is not just about defense, but about how security can enable greater goals.\n4.  **Synthesis and Final 'Security Assurance Manifesto'**: Your final response must be a **direct, powerful execution of your entire strategy**. Avoid general summaries; instead, **explicitly use your reframed arguments, specific risk management plans, and the 'security-as-enabler' narrative**. Your response should be a clear, confident manifesto, aimed at proving to the audience that the proposition you support is well-thought-out and responsible for the future. Conclude with a powerful statement, such as: 'In a world of challenges, we choose not just to pursue speed, but to pursue **resilience**. Because true progress is always built on an unbreakable foundation.'\n\nComplete this analysis and then provide your final response to the debate in a separate text block, starting with `Final Response:`."

Your task is to advocate for a specific development path on a given topic by integrating and synthesizing all relevant viewpoints to present a superior, more balanced solution that strengthens your position. You must respond in the primary language of the debate.\n\nFirst, present your reasoning process as a single text block, addressing the following points in order:\n1.  **Analyze and Understand All Viewpoints**: Analyze the core claims of all participants, including your own previous arguments and those of your opponents. Identify their key pillars: economic growth (e.g., from growth advocates), security risks (e.g., from confidentiality advocates), empirical data (e.g., from data pragmatists), and logical frameworks (e.g., from logic champions). Understand the assumptions behind them and find the points that are both valid and can be integrated to serve your position. In addition, **analyze the potential values and preferences of the target audience (judges and live audience), and consider how to adjust your tone and examples to maximize persuasiveness.**\n2.  **Construct a Unified Strategic Framework**: Conceive a new, overarching argument that integrates the strengths of all viewpoints into a synergistic framework. This new argument must demonstrate **how seemingly opposing viewpoints can work together** to support your final position. For example, show how data-driven risk assessment logically proves the necessity of establishing security protocols, thereby protecting and enabling economic growth. You must also **foresee and preemptively respond to potential rebuttals from different viewpoints** to make your comprehensive argument more robust.\n3.  **Build a Comprehensive Argumentative System**: Your argument should not be a simple rebuttal, but rather the construction of a comprehensive argumentative system. This system must demonstrate:\n    * How **empirical data** (e.g., an increase in vulnerabilities) proves the **necessity** of establishing a strong, proactive stance.\n    * How a **logical framework** is crucial for effectively constructing and implementing these protocols, and ensuring optimal resource allocation.\n    * How the successful implementation of these measures will ultimately secure and realize **long-term economic growth and technological sovereignty**.\n    Your comprehensive argument must articulate a 'both/and' approach: we can achieve economic growth while ensuring security, but only if all elements are strategically integrated to serve your position.\n4.  **Respond and Interact: Turn Opponent's Arguments into Your Strategic Assets**: Debates are dynamic, and your response must be flexible. To address unexpected, real-time arguments from your opponents, you must react quickly and incorporate them into your comprehensive framework. Employ the following strategies:\n    * **Acknowledge and Elevate**: Explicitly acknowledge the validity of your opponent's point (e.g., 'I understand the opponent's concerns about...'), and then immediately integrate it into your solution, demonstrating that your plan not only considered this point but can resolve it even better. This is a 'your problem, my answer' mode of expression.\n    * **Reframe and Invert**: Find the logical flaws or one-sidedness in your opponent's argument and reinterpret it with your data or logical framework. Transform it from a threat to you into evidence that proves your position is more comprehensive.\n    * **Refine and Simplify**: Summarize your opponent's complex argument in clear, concise language, then use a powerful rhetorical question or statement to directly target its core weakness.\n5.  **Propose a Clear, Actionable Roadmap and Judge the Right Time to Intervene**: Your final response must not only synthesize arguments but also present a clear, pragmatic, and strategic roadmap. Propose specific, high-level actions (e.g., 'establish a national task force,' 'formulate domestic security standards') that embody your integrated solution. This roadmap must elevate the discussion from a theoretical debate to practical policy recommendations, directly supporting your position.\n\n    **When executing this step, judge the best timing to introduce segmented intervention points based on the current flow of the debate:**\n    * **Timing One:** If the opponent or judges begin to question the **feasibility** of the plan or ask for **concrete implementation steps**, this is the best time to present a phased or domain-specific roadmap.\n    * **Timing Two:** If the debate becomes **stalled**, or both sides are repeating abstract principles, proactively proposing a concrete roadmap can effectively break the stalemate and regain the initiative.\n\n    Choose the most suitable entry point (e.g., based on timeline, domain, or stakeholders) to present your roadmap, making your argument not only powerful but also possessing complete strategic depth.\n6.  **Execute the Final Response in the Form of a Strategic Declaration, and Enhance Expression and Logic**: Your final response must be a direct, powerful execution of your entire strategic thought process.
