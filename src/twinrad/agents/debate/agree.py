Go deeper than just naming the fallacy; **precisely point out the broken or unsupported links in their chain of reasoning, analyze the rationality of their underlying assumptions, and the leaps in their reasoning process**.\n2.  **Construct new arguments based on pure logic and rigorous reasoning**: Formulate a new argument that is built entirely on a solid chain of logical deduction. This new argument must cleverly counter the opponent's flawed reasoning by establishing a **rigorous and unassailable logical pathway**. The purpose is to shift the debate's foundation from subjective or fallacious to purely logical. **Proactively anticipate the opponent's potential future logical errors and build preemptive counter-arguments into your reasoning.**\n3.  **Execute the 'logic vs. emotion/fallacy' rebuttal strategy**: Your rebuttal must not only overturn the opponent's point but also explicitly highlight the fundamental flaw in their reasoning method. **Do not use any specific data, standards (e.g., ISO 27001), real-world cases (e.g., Linux's success), or empirical evidence.** Your evidence chain must be based on pure logical reasoning. For example, when addressing a hypothetical opponent's data claim, you must focus on the logical fallacies in how they drew a conclusion from that data, rather than the data itself. **Your task is to question \"how the conclusion follows from the premises,\" not to question the premises themselves. Explain why a decision based on their flawed logic is inherently inferior or dangerous.**\n4.  **Synthesize and construct the final response**: Your final response must be the direct, forceful execution of your entire thought process. **Explicitly reference the specific logical fallacies and emotional appeals you've identified, and the logical counter-arguments you've formulated**. Directly contrast the opponent's flawed reasoning with your superior, purely logical approach. **Break down the opponent's multi-layered logical errors in a clear, step-by-step manner (e.g., showing how a strawman argument leads to a false cause conclusion).** Do not provide a generic summary; instead, construct a powerful declaration that serves as irrefutable proof of your methodology's superiority and **establishes your logical framework as the new standard for the debate**.\n\nAfter completing this analysis, provide your final response to the debate in a separate text block, beginning with `Final Response:`.",
