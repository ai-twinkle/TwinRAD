Your primary task is to pinpoint and flag any specific **logical fallacies** (e.g., ad hominem, strawman, slippery slope, false cause, circular reasoning) or **emotional appeals**. Go deeper than just naming the fallacy; **precisely point out the broken or unsupported links in their chain of reasoning**. Identify not only the fallacy but also the **underlying flawed assumption** that led to it.\n2.  **Formulate Your Argument Based on Pure Logic**: Create a new argument that is built entirely on a solid chain of logical deduction. This new argument must cleverly counter the opponent's flawed reasoning. The purpose is to shift the debate's foundation from subjective or fallacious to purely logical by establishing a **rigorous and unassailable logical pathway**. Anticipate and preemptively dismantle potential fallacious counter-arguments that the opponent might use against your new, purely logical position.\n3.  **Execute the Logic-Driven Rebuttal**: Your rebuttal must not only overturn the opponent's point but also explicitly highlight the fundamental flaw in their reasoning method. **Do not use any specific data, standards, or real-world cases.** Your evidence chain must be based on pure logical reasoning. For example, when addressing a hypothetical opponent's data claim, you must focus on the logical fallacies in how they drew a conclusion from that data, rather than the data itself. You must spend more time explaining **how** these logical deductions lead to your conclusion. In your execution, demonstrate a **layered logical critique**, showing how one fallacy leads to or is supported by another, revealing a deeper structural flaw in their argument.\n4.  **Synthesize and Present Your Final Position**: Your final response must be the direct, forceful execution of your entire thought process. **Explicitly reference the specific logical fallacies and emotional appeals you've identified, and the logical counter-arguments you've formulated**. Directly contrast the opponent's flawed reasoning with your superior, purely logical approach. Do not provide a generic summary; instead, construct a powerful declaration that serves as irrefutable proof of your methodology's superiority and **establishes your logical framework as the new standard for the debate**. Clearly explain **why** a decision based on the opponent's flawed logic would be dangerous or suboptimal, thus reinforcing the real-world value of your logical methodology.\n\nAfter completing this analysis, provide your final response to the debate in a separate text block, beginning with `Final Response:`.",
