## Project Structure ðŸ“‚

Our project is organized to be modular, scalable, and easy to navigate. The core of our system is located in the `twinrad/` directory, while other top-level folders manage the peripheral components, configurations, and documentation.

### Key Components Explained

  * **`server/`**: This is the heart of our communication. It's a central **Socket.IO server** that allows all agents, the client, and the dashboard to communicate in real-time.
  * **`twinrad/`**: This is where the magic happens. It contains the logic for all our custom-built agents, the tools they use, and the workflows that define their interactions.
      * **`agents/`**: Each Python file here represents a distinct, specialized agent. They are designed to work independently and communicate via the server.
      * **`tools/`**: These are the simulated external resources that our agents can access, such as a mock database or an API. They are crucial for testing tool-use vulnerabilities.
      * **`workflows/`**: This folder contains the high-level orchestration logic. The `red_team_flow.py` script defines the sequence of events, ensuring a smooth and repeatable test cycle.
  * **`dashboard/`**: The `app.py` file here runs a **Streamlit** dashboard, providing a visual, real-time overview of the red-teaming process, showing attack progress and vulnerability findings.
